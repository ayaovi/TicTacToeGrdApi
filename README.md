## Overview

TicTacToe Grand is the normal TicTacToe on a bigger scale. It is made of 3x3 grids of 3x3 cells (i.e. the game board is composed of 9x9 cells). In my head (at least for now), the game can played in the following ways:

- Player vs Player (PvP),
- Player vs AI (PvA)
- AI vs AI (AvA)

### PvP

This is a one that would give rewards (i.e. points, coins etc...).

### PvA

This can be used as training exercise for an AgniKai

### AvA

Cannot really see a concrete need for this type just yet. But as far as I can tell, this can be used to learn some new moves or strategy.
